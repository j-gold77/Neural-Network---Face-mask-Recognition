# AI Face Mask Detector 

The purpose of this project is to a use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train and test our program into recognizing what type of mask a person is wearing. The types of masks are Surgical, Cloth, N95 and there's also NoMask. Thus using the principles of Deep Learning with a vision-based neural network. 

This repository contains the Dataset folder, which includes the 4 categories of masks mentioned above, containing around 4.6k images for training and testing. Our Models folder where we have saved our trained model which we can later reuse with all the knowledge that it possesses. The Models folder contains the DatasetSample, which is a sample set of 100 images, the How-to-Run instructions which specify what needs to be before running the program, and the Model.pt file itself. And finally, there is the Results folder where all the matrices (of both training and testing) and data have been collected and stored from our most recent run of the program.
